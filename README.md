# JavaBlackjack

This is a console-based Java Blackjack Game, where gameplay is simulated through text, ASCII art,
and user input.

I coded this project to familiarize myself with Java and Object-Oriented Programming as well as to 
get a leg up on coding larger projects.

The game currently has no visuals but in the future I might return to it and add sprites and increase player
interactability.

The program fully simulates blackjack, with betting, achievements, and statistics that the player can access.
